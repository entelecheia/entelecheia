project_description: AI's development and transformation have the potential to reshape
    various aspects of life. Inspired by Aristotle's concept of entelecheia, AI should
    achieve its intended goals while incorporating human-like intelligence and adhering
    to ethical guidelines. NLP, finance, and economics are areas where AI can make
    a significant impact, but it's crucial to ensure alignment with societal values.
    As AI progresses, addressing ethical and societal consequences is essential to
    achieve entelecheia and serve the greater good of humanity.
