ἐντελέχεια is coined by Aristotle from ἐντελής (entelḗs, “complete, full, accomplished”) + ἔχειν (ékhein, “have, hold”).

AI's development and transformation have the potential to reshape various aspects of life. Inspired by Aristotle's concept of entelecheia, AI should achieve its intended goals while incorporating human-like intelligence and adhering to ethical guidelines. NLP, finance, and economics are areas where AI can make a significant impact, but it's crucial to ensure alignment with societal values. As AI progresses, addressing ethical and societal consequences is essential to achieve entelecheia and serve the greater good of humanity.
